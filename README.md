FingerFinder is an OpenCV project designed to recognize and track finger patterns that represent the digits 1-5.

The project uses computer vision techniques to extract and analyze features of the finger patterns, such as shape, size, and orientation.

It can detect the position, orientation, and movement of individual fingers to identify the corresponding digit.

FingerFinder can be used in various applications, such as sign language translation, gesture recognition, and human-computer interaction.

The project provides a reliable and scalable solution for digit recognition using finger patterns,enabling developers to create innovative applications.
